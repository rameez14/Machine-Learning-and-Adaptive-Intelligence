    "# Probability and an Introduction to Jupyter, Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29th September 2015 Neil Lawrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you think about normal programming, or 'classical software engineering'. Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn't doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you don't understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lecture we will think a little about 'how we got here' in terms of computer science. In the lecture itself, this will be done by taking a subjective perspective, that of my own 'data autobiography'."

    "\n",
    "### Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). A new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/index.html). "

    "#### Question 1 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was invented by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s as it was created and implemented and offically used in December 1989. The reason why Guido Van Rossum invented the language Python because he did it out of interest and the other reason was because he was a successor ABC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed for a general use and a high level of programming language. Python was designed for developing and implementing desktop GUI applications, websites and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why Guido Van Rossum named Python as Python because at the same time he was reading Monty Python's Flying Circus, this is a BBC comedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically Python is not a complied language. Python is a interpreted langauage because when a developer writes Python code or programs it changes the source code to intermediate language which is changed and converted into native language or otherwise reffered to as machine language before it is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a object oriented language as it implements and uses traditinal class architecture. However, Python  does not support strong encapsulation as this is one of the main features of an object oriented language."

We will be learning how to make use of the notebook throughout the course. The notebook allows us to combine code with descriptions, interactive visualizations, plots etc. In fact it allows us to do many of the things we need for data science. Notebooks can also be easily shared through the internet for ease of communication of ideas. The box this text is written in is a *markdown* box. Below we have a *code* box."

The result of this command on its own is a data series of `True` and `False` values. However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

    "Matplotlib is also reffered to as a plotting library for Python programming language and mainly its numerical extension mainly regarding NumPy. This has a object oriented API plots. Matplotlib gives plotting for data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy regards a specific library of software engineering and also science. SciPy has differnent components which have linear algebra, optimization, integration and integration. The main feature of SciPy library is based around Numpy and arrays, this gives benefical numerical integration, optimization as well as muliple other features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas regards a Python package constructed to collabrate with 'labled' and 'relational' data. Pandas is a ideal tool for data munging.The main of this is for fast data mainpulation.\n",

    "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the progamming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a free open-source web application which allows individuals to generate and share documents that has specific lines code, equations, visualizations and texts. It is also reffered to as an interative computing enviroment that permits the users to contain code, images as well as multiple more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell jupyter is a open source project a software that does certain things. Jupyter is ideal for collaborative as it is a vital tool, in essesnce its ideal for collaborating work together. The main purpose and aim of Jupyter is to write as well as share code on a web page, the code is able to run on a server and the outcome is a HTML. Jupyter can be saved, shared accrossed and placed onto GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a open standard platform for an interactive computing programming. Jupyter was invented as a branch off IPython in the year of 2014 by a individual named Fernando Perez. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are muliple functionality and components of jupyter. Jupyter has mainly three functionalites/components, the notebook web application which is used for writing and updating code in the notebook, kernals is a process where the user runs his/her code in the language preferred which returns back to the notebook web application and notebook documents which has all the documents containted visible on the noteboook web application web applications. Every unique notebook document has it seperate own kernal. More functonalities include GUI, autosave.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook web application will allow the users the following, edit code, run the code from the browser, JavaScript widgets, narrative texts and maths equations such as LaTeX syntax in Markdown. \n",

    "As stated earlier jupyter notebook is a open standard software which comprises of multiple programming languages. Jupyter notebook is a open standard web application which allows the users to implement as well as share documents that has live code visulaization as well as narrative text. The jupyter notebook can handle more than 40 languages, distribute different notebooks, it also supports interactive outcomes including HTML, custom MIME types as well as multiple more and it supports data tools including Apache Spark   \n",

    "A probability distribution expresses uncertainty about the outcome of an event. We often encode this uncertainty in a variable. So if we are considering the outcome of an event, $Y$, to be a coin toss, then we might consider $Y=1$ to be heads and $Y=0$ to be tails. We represent the probability of a given outcome with the notation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=1) = 0.5\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=0) = 1-P(Y=1) = 0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities are often defined as the limit of the ratio between the number of positive outcomes (e.g. *heads*) given the number of trials. If the number of positive outcomes for event $y$ is denoted by $n_y$ and the number of trials is denoted by $N$ then this gives the ratio \n",

    "#### Question 4 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the estimate seems higher than greater than 40 deaths and the problem and wrong because in total there was 421 films in listed and if all films were taken into consideration the estimate would of have been different. I dont think that any film you go into the cinema has this probality of over 40 deaths because some films do not have deaths attributed and also there are only 421 films listed. Another reason why the esimate could be wrong is that only a small popoulation of films were counted as this is not consistent as all years should be taken into consideration. If everything was taken into consideration the estimate could of been higher or lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we used float around the counts of death because originally it was an int which means if we divide an int by an int it will give a result of an int even though the answer might be a decimal. It also will convert it into a string and will the location of the decimal point, in essesnce the lenght of the string.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of number types in Python which are int and float. Both of these commands work same manner as you are able to add floating numbers within the parentheses in order to change it to a integer, in essesnce the answer would have been the same. However, it would of had made sense if the developer used int instead of float because you cannot have decimal number representing people as for example 40.1 people, int would of had made it 40 people which makes sense.

    "# Conditioning\n",

    "When predicting whether a coin turns up head or tails, we might think that this event is *independent* of the year or time of day. If we include an observation such as time, then in a probability this is known as *conditioning*. We use this notation, $P(Y=y|T=t)$, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case time). Or, often, for a shorthand we use $P(y|t)$ to represent this distribution (the $Y=$ and $T=$ being implicit). Because we don't believe a coin toss depends on time then we might write that \n",

We represent a joint probability using the notation $P(Y=y, T=t)$ or $P(y, t)$ for short. Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what's the probability that the number of deaths was over 40 and the year was 2002?

It's not difficult to derive, and its importance is more to do with the semantic operation that it enables. Each of these probability distributions represents the answer to a question we have about the world. Bayes rule (via the product rule) tells us how to *invert* the probability."

A conditional distribution in this case would of been a probality distribution for an accumalation in this terms the ratings. In essence this means that it will highlight and demonstrate a casual item or object which has certain characteristic. In this case we were predicting and examing the number the ratings attributed to a film, this can be made easier with the aid and help of a table. It acctually highly depends on both actors and director, an actor could be good at certain roles but useless at everything else. But the genre can change easily as it is not consistent, there could also be a combination of genre and actor which could of changed the ratings.\n",

    "The distribution and the condition should be based on number of actors that appear in certain films and take on certain roles. It could also appear on director and the ratings of the film. If an actor is good as his/her role the rating of the film will most likey go higher and if the role played is wrong the ratings will go lower. Moreover, it is also based on the director because if the director is good and the film well executed the rating will go higher if not the ratings will go lower. "
